ambiguousClass = Class specification matches more than one class.

ambiguousMethod = Method is overloaded; please specify arguments.

breakpointHit = Hit breakpoint

brkOnlyInClass = Breakpoints cannot be set in interfaces or arrays.

classPrepared = Class prepared:
classUnloaded = Class unloaded:

conditionSatisFailed = Condition isSatisfied() failed:

condition.notBoolean = Condition expression must be a boolean.

error.breakpointNoClass = Breakpoint {0} had no 'class'
error.conditionNoClass = Condition {0} had no 'class'
error.monitorNoClass = Monitor {0} had no 'class'
error.readBreakpoint = Failed to read breakpoint {0}
error.readBreakpointGroup = Failed to read breakpoint group {0}
error.readCondition = Failed to read condition {0}
error.readMonitor = Failed to read monitor {0}

error.writeBreakpointGroup = Failed to save breakpoint group {0}

exceptionThrown = Exception thrown:

invalidSyntax = Invalid breakpoint syntax.

invalidArgumentType = Invalid argument type:

missingClassName = No class name given.
# Space between parens because JLabel uses bold font
missingMethodName = Missing method name before ( ).
missingMethodArgs = Missing method arguments; need ( ).

noCodeAtLine = No code at that line in the class.

# User requested information where there was none.
noLineNumberInfo = There is no line number information for this class.

noRemoveDefault = Cannot remove default group.

noSuchMethod = No matching method found in the class.

suspendNone = (suspend no threads)
suspendThread = (suspend event thread)

unknownError = Unexpected error:
