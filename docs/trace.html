    <h3>Method Traces</h3>

    <p>JSwat supports setting traces. A trace is a breakpoint that is
    hit every time any method is entered or exited. As you might
    imagine, this generates a lot of events. Thus, it is vitally
    important that the trace has a class and/or thread filter. See the
    <a href="breakpoints.html">breakpoints help</a> for the section on
    setting up filters.</p>

    <p>By default, the trace breakpoint does not suspend the debuggee
    VM. It would be rather useless to do so, but the option is
    available via the breakpoint properties dialog box.</p>

    <p>The <code>trace</code> command can be used to create a trace.
    There is also a dialog box available from the
    &quot;Breakpoints&quot; menu. The command requires that you specify
    the name of a class to act as the class filter. You could specify
    &#39;<code>all</code>&#39; but I do not recommend it.</p>

    <p>Although trace breakpoints are like any other breakpoint and
    support conditions and monitors, it has not been tested. At the
    very least, the suspend policy has to be changed from
    &quot;none&quot; to either &quot;thread&quot; or
    &quot;all&quot;.</p>
