  <h2>FindBugs</h2>

  <p><a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/">FindBugs</a> is a
  static analysis tool that operates on the bytecode of your Java
  appliation to identify bugs in the code itself. Some of the
  &quot;bugs&quot; it finds are not so important, but many of them are
  worth evaluation. On average, the false positive rate is low enough
  to make using the tool worth while.</p>

  <h3>Using it to Find Bugs</h3>

  <p>Using FindBugs on JSwat is pretty straight forward. Launch the
  FindBugs program and the main window should appear. In the project
  settings window, specify the root of the JSwat source tree (e.g.
  <code>core/src</code>), the build directory (e.g.
  <code>core/build</code>), and the <code>.jar</code> files that are
  included in the classpath for that module (e.g.
  <code>platform5/core/org-openide.jar</code>, et cetra). See the
  module <code>build.xml</code> file for the classpath. Once the
  project settings are defined, click the &quot;Find Bugs&quot; button
  to have the tool perform its analysis.</p>

  <p>An even simpler method of using FindBugs is to get the NetBeans
  plugin, available <a href=
  "http://fnleisurehacker.fn.funpic.de/wordpress/?page_id=102">here</a>.
  Once the NetBeans plugin is installed, just select the JSwat project
  and invoke the FindBugs action from the main toolbar in the NetBeans
  IDE.</p>

  <p>There are some bugs that should not be fixed. These are either not
  really bugs (i.e. a string comparison using the equals operator is
  not always wrong), or they are bizarre in some way or another and I
  cannot understand what the tool is trying to tell me (e.g. an obscure
  runtime exception that is not explicitly caught, such as
  <code>NoSuchFieldException</code>). In general though, there should
  be very few problems overall.</p>
