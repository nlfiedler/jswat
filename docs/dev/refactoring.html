  <h2>The Great Refactoring of 2001</h2>

  <h3>Why The Change?</h3>

  <p>What was so wrong with JSwat that brought on this big redesign?
  Basically everything. The program was written under the assumption
  that there would always be a graphical interface. Thus, many
  shortcuts were taken in the design and implementation. In particular,
  there was a lot of dependence on a class called
  <code>MainWindow</code>. This was referenced by the
  <code>Session</code>, most of the actions, and even some
  commands.</p>

  <p>The change was really brought about when a user named Jack
  suggested to me that JSwat should support a console-only mode. This
  intrigued me since I fancied the notion that JSwat was so well
  designed that this sort of feature should be easy. Ha! It took three
  weeks (well, really two) to change all of the classes to support an
  arbitrary interface. The rest of this page outlines what was done to
  make this possible.</p>

  <h3>What Had To Go</h3>

  <p>First, the <code>UIBuilder</code> class had to be replaced by
  something more generalized for building any type of interface.
  Second, the <code>MainWindow</code> references had to be replaced
  with references to the new generalized class. The
  <code>CommandManager</code> class had to stop managing its own
  interface components, namely the text input field and key press
  listener. The <code>Session</code> had to sever its ties with the
  <code>UiBuilder</code> and <code>MainWindow</code> classes, as well
  as all of the panels.</p>

  <h3>How That Was Done</h3>

  <p>All of these goals were achieved by the introduction of the
  &quot;interface adapter&quot; class. This class would be responsible
  for building and managing the entire user interface. That meant
  building the main window, menu bar, tool bar, panels, and handling
  source view windows. A new interface was written to provide the basic
  API for the rest of the program to interact with the user. This is
  called the <code>UIAdapter</code> and it has two implementations
  provided with the JSwat source code.</p>

  <h4>GraphicalAdapter</h4>

  <p>The <code>GraphicalAdapter</code> class builds out the usual
  graphical interface that most JSwat users are accustomed to. It makes
  the main window, menu bar, tool bar, and panels, as well as handling
  the source view windows. It provides the mediators for displaying
  JSwat messages, taking command input, displaying the debuggee output,
  and entering debuggee input.</p>

  <h4>ConsoleAdapter</h4>

  <p>The <code>ConsoleAdapter</code> class constructs a very simple
  interface. It receives typed input from the user via the
  <code>System.in</code> input stream and displays messages to the
  <code>System.out</code> output stream. It is a purely console-based
  interface, much like the well-loved <code>jdb</code> debugger that
  comes with the JDK. There are no panels, no dialogs, no toolbars, and
  no source views. JSwat messages and debuggee output are both printed
  to the same place as that is the only place to do so. Sending input
  to the debuggee is made possible via the <code>stdin</code> command,
  which sends its arguments to the debuggee&#39;s
  <code>System.in</code> input stream.</p>

  <h3>How This Has Helped</h3>

  <p>Granted, most people are not going to rush out and use the console
  mode of JSwat, but it has brought about necessary changes in the
  program&#39;s design. The classes were too tightly-coupled and
  inflexible for there to be any chance of future expansion. In
  addition, it has made David Taylor&#39;s task of writing a plugin for
  <a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a> much easier. This, I am
  sure, is something that at least some JSwat users can appreciate. In
  the future, it will be much easier to write other interfaces to
  JSwat, allowing for more widespread use and acceptance.</p>
