  <title>Starting the Debuggee</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h2>Starting the debuggee</h2>

  <p>The very first thing you are likely to do with JSwat is start
  debugging your Java code. This is done through one of several
  means.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Using the &quot;Start VM&quot; item in the &quot;VM&quot; menu,
    or the &quot;new document&quot; icon in the toolbar.</li>

    <li>Using the <code>load</code> command. See the command
    documentation using <code>help load</code> at the command
    prompt.</li>

    <li>Connecting to the remote debuggee. See the help on <a href=
    "remote.html">remote debugging</a> for more information.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The first option is typically the most popular since it involves
  the least amount of typing and offers the most visual cues for the
  required information. The rest of this help file will discuss this
  option exclusively.</p>

  <h3>The fields</h3>

  <p>The input fields of the Start VM dialog are described as
  follows.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><em>Java Home</em></dt>

    <dd>This is the directory containing the Java runtime. Typically
    this is filled in with a default value and does not need to be
    adjusted. If at some point the location has changed, simply clear
    the field to have JSwat rediscover the new location automatically
    (after pressing OK to this dialog). If this fails for any reason,
    you will need to enter the path to the &quot;jre&quot; directory
    manually.</dd>

    <dt><em>JVM Executable</em></dt>

    <dd>This is the name of the <code>java</code> executable. The
    default should be acceptable in nearly all cases, but should your
    case differ, you can change the name to whatever is appropriate for
    the Java runtime being used.</dd>

    <dt><em>Debuggee VM Options</em></dt>

    <dd>These are options to the debuggee JVM, such as
    <code>-X<em>xxx</em></code>, <code>-hotspot</code>,
    <code>-cp</code>, <code>-jar</code>, and <code>-D</code>. When
    using the <code>-jar</code> option, you may put the name of the jar
    file in this field or the Class name field described below.
    However, the next time the Start VM dialog appears, the jar file
    name will be in the Class name field.</dd>

    <dt><em>Class name and arguments</em></dt>

    <dd>Like the label says, this is the name of the class to be
    debugged, along with any arguments expected by that class. If the
    <code>-jar</code> option is used, this field holds the name of the
    jar file rather than the name of the class. The jar file must have
    the <strong>Main-Class</strong> property set in the manifest for
    the <code>-jar</code> option to work.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3>Canonicalized options</h3>

  <p>You may recall the option in the &quot;Options&quot; menu for
  enabling the Classic VM support in the debuggee. With this feature
  enabled, the <code>-classic</code> option will automatically be used
  in launching the debuggee. However, the option will <em>not</em>
  appear in the Start VM dialog&#39;s VM Options field. The same is
  true for the classpath definition. You can define the classpath using
  the <code>classpath</code> command or the &quot;Set Classpath&quot;
  dialog, accessible from the &quot;Options&quot; menu, and that will
  be passed to the debuggee automatically.</p>

  <p>Both of these options are automatically added to the set of JVM
  options given in the Start VM dialog during the launching process,
  but only under certain conditions. For the Classic VM option, if
  <code>-client</code>, <code>-hotspot</code>, <code>-server</code>, or
  <code>-classic</code> option appears in the JVM options field, then
  the Classic VM feature is silently ignored.</p>

  <p>Similarly, if the JVM Options field contains the <code>-cp</code>
  or <code>-classpath</code> option, the classpath defined via the
  <code>classpath</code> command or the &quot;Set Classpath&quot;
  dialog is ignored. Instead, the argument to the <code>-cp</code> or
  <code>-classpath</code> option is used.</p>

  <h3>What to do next</h3>

  <p>After filling in the fields in the Start VM dialog, press the OK
  button and wait a few seconds. You should soon see the debuggee JVM
  start up and invoke the <code>main</code> method of the class named
  in the dialog. Assuming your program does not exit immediately, you
  are ready to begin debugging.</p>

  <p>Now go back to the help index and read more about JSwat under the
  General Topics section.</p>
