Known problems in JDK
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Locals panel code may sometimes report an InconsistentDebugInfoException
  which is caused by the javac compiler (compiler bug #4349534).
- Cannot catch java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException (jdi bug
  #4505697).


JPDA Issues in JDK1.4.0_02 (courtesy of the JPDA folks)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The RedefineClasses feature of JPDA had several problems in jdk1.4.0.
Most of these problems will be fixed in jdk1.4.0_02. This note points
out some bugs that are not fixed in 1.4.0_02, and also has some other
information on the RedefineClasses feature.

- JDI method ThreadReference.PopFrames has a bug that can be triggered when
  full speed debugging is in effect.  The bug can occur in cases where the
  frame that is to be popped, or the frame that is to be popped to
  has been compiled and some of its callee's have been inlined by the compiler.

  A workaround for this is to suppress full speed debugging by running the
  debuggee with -Xint (which turn off Hotspot compilation and  will make the
  debuggee run more slowly).

  This is bug
       4647643 SEGV or SIGBUS in JVM with PopAsynchronousTest.

  It will be fixed in JDK 1.4.1.

- It appears that problems can occur if breakpoints are set and later cleared
  in methods that have been redefined.  We are still looking into this.
  This is bug:
     4705330: Netbeans Fix and Continue crashes JVM

  The problem seems to occur with breakpoints in methods that are in the
  redefined class, but are _not_ changed by the redefine operation (see the
  discussion of 'equivalent' methods in the RedefineClasses section of
  the JVMDI spec.)  We hope to fix this in JDK 1.4.1.

- Step operations in an existing activation of a redefined method behave
  differently due to the lack of line number information.
  Step requests with these sizes / depths will behave as shown here:

    STEP_LINE / STEP_INTO  -> does STEP_MIN / STEP_INTO
   *STEP_LINE / STEP_OVER  -> does STEP_MIN / STEP_OUT
    STEP_LINE / STEP_OUT   -> works as expected

    STEP_MIN / STEP_INTO   -> works as expected
    STEP_MIN / STEP_OVER   -> works as expected
    STEP_MIN / STEP_OUT    -> works as expected

   *This is bug:
      4689395 "step over" after a class is redefined acts like "step out"

- JDI method StackFrame.thisObject() currently throws a
  com.sun.jdi.InternalException ("Unexpected JDWP Error: 23") if the
  StackFrame object is for the activation of a method that has been
  redefined. This is bug: 4660477: After a redefineClasses,
  StackFrame.thisObject() gets JDWP Error 23
