  <h2>What is it?</h2>

  <p>JSwat is a graphical Java debugger front-end, written for the Java
  2 platform, utilizing the <a href=
  "http://java.sun.com/products/jpda/">Java Platform Debugger
  Architecture</a> (JPDA). The source code is licensed under the
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
  License</a>. This version of the software has entered maintenace
  mode. Generally only bug fixes are being made to this line of the
  code. See the <a href="http://www.bluemarsh.com/java/jswat/">web
  site</a> for the latest version of the debugger.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <h3>J2SE</h3>

  <p>JSwat requires the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">Java 2
  Standard Edition</a>, version 1.4 or higher. Compatible software from
  other vendors may be used, if so desired.</p>

  <h3>JPDA</h3>

  <p>The Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) software, which is
  included in most releases of the J2SE, is utilized by JSwat to carry
  out its debugging activities. The required classes are typically
  found in the <code>&lt;jdk&gt;\lib\tools.jar</code> file, and begin
  with the prefix <code>com.sun.jdi</code> (where JDI stands for Java
  Debug Interface).</p>

  <h3>Other Libraries</h3>

  <p>JSwat includes additional jar files containing libraries that are
  utilized by the program. They are referenced by the manifest of the
  JSwat jar file and must be kept in the same directory as the JSwat
  jar file. The jar files do not have to be in your classpath, though
  it would not hurt if they were.</p>

  <h3>Debug Info</h3>

  <p>JSwat, like most Java debuggers, requires that the classes to be
  debugged be compiled using the <kbd>-g</kbd> flag. In addition, do
  not compile the classes with the optimization flags, as that may
  hinder debugging. If you are using <a href=
  "http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> to build your application, include
  <code>debug=&quot;on&quot;</code> in the <code>javac</code> task,
  which will generate the debug info during compilation.</p>

  <h2>Starting JSwat</h2>

  <p>There are basically two ways to start JSwat: easy and not so easy.
  If you are running Microsoft Windows then you can use the
  <strong><code>jswat.bat</code></strong> batch file. If you are
  running a Unix-like system then you can use the
  <strong><code>jswat</code></strong> shell script. Otherwise, you can
  start JSwat <strong>manually</strong>, as shown below.</p>

  <p style="margin: 0 2em 1em"><kbd>java
  -Djava.ext.dirs=&lt;JAVA_HOME&gt;\lib -jar
  &lt;JSWAT_HOME&gt;\jswat.jar</kbd></p>

  <p style="margin: 0 2em 0"><em>Unix users must replace <kbd>\</kbd>
  with <kbd>/</kbd> in the line above.</em></p>

  <p style="margin: 0 2em 0"><em>Mac OS X users can leave out the -D
  option entirely.</em></p>

  <p>Note that <code>JAVA_HOME</code> is the path to the JDK, while
  <code>JSWAT_HOME</code> is the path to the <code>jswat.jar</code>
  file. The <code>&lt;JAVA_HOME&gt;\lib</code> directory must contain
  the <code>tools.jar</code> file in order for JSwat to start. This
  file contains the JPDA classes (<code>com.sun.jdi</code>) used by
  JSwat. If the file containing these classes is located elsewhere in
  your system, you must make the appropriate change to the command used
  to invoke JSwat.</p>

  <h3>Passing Arguments</h3>

  <p>JSwat can accept a string of commands to be executed as soon as it
  has completed its startup. These commands are passed at the end of
  the command line used to start the program. Here are some
  examples:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><kbd>java ... jswat.jar load -client MyClass arg1
    arg2</kbd></li>

    <li><kbd>java ... jswat.jar attach mymachine:1234</kbd></li>

    <li style="list-style: none"><kbd>java ... jswat.jar &quot;load
    MyClass; stop MyClass:120; resume&quot;</kbd></li>

    <li><kbd>java ... jswat.jar \&quot;classpath
    cp1;cp2;cp3\&quot;</kbd></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Read the help section titled &quot;Commands&quot; to learn more
  about using JSwat commands. Note that the last example uses slashes
  to escape the quotes used on the command line. See the appropriate
  documentation for your command shell to learn more.</p>

  <h3>Other Ways to Start JSwat</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <div>
        As an alternative to using the Java Extensions Mechanism, you
        may append to the boot classpath, like so:
      </div>
      <pre>
java -Xbootclasspath/a:&lt;JAVA_HOME&gt;\lib\tools.jar -jar &lt;JSWAT_HOME&gt;\jswat.jar
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>
      <div>
        For a shorter invocation, list the aforementioned
        <code>tools.jar</code> file and the JSwat jar files in your
        classpath and invoke the program with this simple command:
      </div>
      <pre>
java com.bluemarsh.jswat.Main
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>
      <div>
        Another short invocation can be accomplished by copying the
        <code>tools.jar</code> file to the
        <code>&lt;JAVA_HOME&gt;\jre\lib\ext</code> directory, then
        starting JSwat like so:
      </div>
      <pre>
java -jar &lt;JSWAT_HOME&gt;\jswat.jar
</pre>

      <p>Note that the <kbd>-jar</kbd> option causes the classpath
      setting to be ignored. This includes the path following the
      <kbd>-cp</kbd> or <kbd>-classpath</kbd> options, as well as the
      <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Documentation</h2>

  <p>The JSwat documentation is made up primarily of the built-in help.
  Help on JSwat commands is accessed using the &quot;help&quot;
  command. General help topics are available from the &quot;Help&quot;
  menu in JSwat. Additionally, there are several &quot;how to&quot;
  documents on the <a href=
  "http://www.bluemarsh.com/java/jswat/docs/">web site</a>.</p>

  <h2>Stopping JSwat</h2>

  <p>The correct way to exit JSwat is with either the window close
  button, the <kbd>exit</kbd> command, or the Exit item in the File
  menu. Using Ctrl-c to exit JSwat will likely cause problems and
  should be avoided. It must <em>only</em> be used in cases where the
  JVM hosting JSwat has frozen.</p>

  <h2>Removing JSwat</h2>

  <p>Removing JSwat from your system is generally pretty simple. Find
  the files, wherever it is that you originally put them, and delete
  them. If, on the other hand, you used one of the packaged versions
  such as RPM or DEB, you will need to remove the package using the
  appropriate system tool.</p>

  <p>To remove all traces of JSwat from your system, you will need to
  look in only one place. If you are using Microsoft Windows, look in
  the registry under the
  <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\com\bluemarsh\jswat</code>
  key. Users of Unix-like systems will find the JSwat settings stored
  in the <code>~/.java/.userPrefs/com/bluemarsh/jswat/</code>
  directory. You may also have created a <code>jswat.init</code> file,
  so be sure to look for that as well.</p>

  <h2>Platform particulars</h2>

  <p>Below are notes concerning particular platforms and what must be
  done to make JSwat work correctly on them.</p>

  <h3>Mac OS X</h3>

  <p>JSwat is known to work on Mac OS X 10.3 with JDK 1.4.1.</p>

  <p>David Cok reports that on OS X 10.1.5 he was unable to launch the
  debuggee from JSwat, although he could remotely attach to a running
  debuggee. But as he points out, this is true for all of the Java
  debuggers he tested on this platform.</p>

  <p>Marc Hadley, using OS X 10.1.5, says it was necessary for him to
  add the hostname of his machine to the <code>netinfo</code> file.
  Otherwise he got an error about <code>gethostbyname</code> when
  launching the debuggee from within JSwat.</p>

  <h3>Windows</h3>

  <p>The JRE, often installed with the JDK, seems to cause more
  problems than it solves. If JSwat tells you that the JPDA cannot be
  found and you are certain you followed the instructions above
  correctly, then chances are the JRE is getting in the way. Be sure
  that you refer to the <code>java.exe</code> located in the JDK
  <code>bin</code> directory. Otherwise you may inadvertently invoke
  the JRE which is not suitable for debugging.</p>

  <h3>Windows NT and JDK 1.4</h3>

  <p>There seems to be a problem with using JDK 1.4 on Windows NT 4.0,
  relating to the DirectX features. The errors occur in the method
  <code>sun.awt.windows.Win32DDRenderer.doFillRectDD</code>. The
  solution appears to be quite simple, just add the following option
  after <kbd>java</kbd> when starting JSwat:
  <kbd>-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true</kbd></p>

  <h3>Windows 2000/XP and JDK 1.4</h3>

  <p>There seems to be a problem with using JDK 1.4.1 on Windows 2000
  and XP relating to certain video cards. Basically, when the Java
  application exits, the operating system hangs. The relevant bug
  report is on the <a href=
  "http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/bugParade/bugs/4713003.html">
  developer services</a> site, which you may want to read for further
  information. There is a work-around that seems to work for some users
  and is worth trying. Add the following option after <kbd>java</kbd>
  when starting JSwat: <kbd>-Dsun.java2d.d3d=false</kbd></p>

  <p>A problem related to the one described above is that the JSwat
  application seems to hang on startup. Try installing the DirectX
  support in your system to avoid the issue. If that does not work, try
  the option mentioned above, or replace your video card per the bug
  report mentioned above.</p>

  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

  <p>Below are problems you might run into while using JSwat. Each
  offers a solution for either resolving or working around the
  issue.</p>

  <h3>Unable to find JPDA</h3>

  <p>See instructions above and be sure to follow them carefully. Check
  for any relevant information in the &quot;Platform Particulars&quot;
  section.</p>

  <h3>prefs BackingStoreException</h3>

  <p>See the &quot;Preferences Do Not Persist&quot; item.</p>

  <h3>Upgrading to 2.0 message keeps appearing</h3>

  <p>See the &quot;Preferences Do Not Persist&quot; item.</p>

  <h3>Preferences Do Not Persist</h3>

  <p>If the preferences in JSwat are not persisting, you may see one of
  the following symptoms:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>&quot;Updating to 2.0&quot; dialog always displays at
    startup.</li>

    <li><code>java.util.prefs.BackingStoreException</code> occurs,
    maybe mentioning something about an XML parser, such as
    xerces.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The cause of the problem seems to be that an alternate XML parser
  is in the classpath. This XML parser does not understand how to
  handle the JavaSoft Preferences DTD and thus fails to read or write
  the Preferences data.</p>

  <p>The solution is to run JSwat using the <kbd>-jar</kbd> option to
  provide a clean environment in which to run JSwat.</p>

  <p>Simon Hill pointed out that the 2.1 version of the xerces parser
  no longer has the problem described above. If you are using an older
  version of this parser, you may want to upgrade.</p>
