  found only in JDK 1.5.

2.38 - July 30, 2005
- Fixed bug 924: changes to default stratum take effect immediately.
- Fixed bug 925: fix the text area scrolling problem when lots of text
  is added to the text area over and over again.
- Improved JDI event dispatcher exception handling.
- Fixed all compiler warnings when compiling with Java 1.5 JDK.

2.37 - July 10, 2005
- Fixed bug 922: fixed source mapping code so finding source using a
  method location will return the found source.

2.36 - July 4, 2005
- Fixed bug 919: corrected the support for debugging non-Java programming
  languages, such as JSP; can now debug JSP pages directly.
- Added 'source' command to display source-related data about a class,
  useful for determining the appropriate sourcepath for non-Java source
  such as JSP pages.

2.35 - June 26, 2005
- Fixed bug 907: trim leading and trailing whitespace from classpath
  and sourcepath entries.

2.34 - March 31, 2005
- Laurent Martelli provided a French translation of some resources.
- Daniel Bonniot implemented RFE 813: file open dialog source file
  filter now includes .jsp and .nice files (in addition to .java).
- Fixed bug 905: recent files menu and view command opening files
  containing non-Java code meant that breakpoints did not work
  properly (the package name was the absolute file path).

2.33 - February 20, 2005
- Fixed bug 904: breakpoints in non-Java code did not resolve.

  the user, the VM default stratum will be used while debugging.

2.32 - February 5, 2005
- Implemented 831: sort the properties in About dialog.
- Fixed bug 882: several bugs fixed in expression evaluator.
- Fixed bug 902: breakpoints in non-Java code resolved very slowly.
  This also impacted Java code using Java 5.0 features.

2.31 - January 19, 2005
- Fixed bug 900: a line breakpoint created via the source view, in
  a non-public class, whose bytecode is not accessible to JSwat, can
  now be shown in the source view after the view had been closed.

- Fixed bug 885: removing a breakpoint group containing breakpoints
  resulted in an exception.
- Fixed bug 893: check target JVM version before invoking JDI 1.4
  methods (resulted in a crash of the target while connecting).

2.27 - September 21, 2004
- Corrections to the behavior of the combobox in the evaluate dialog.
- Fixed bug 865: added stratum value to allow JSwat to debug classes
  generated from other languages, such as Java Server Pages.

2.26 - September 17, 2004
- Hari Krishna Dara: replaced evaluate dialog's text field with a
  combobox that retains the history of expressions evaluated.
- Fixed bug 872: corrected loop index management in classes panel which
  led to an infinite loop in some situations.

2.25 - August 16, 2004
- Implemented RFE 811: added a close-all-but-this menu item to the
  tabbed views popup menu to close all but the selected source view.
- Fixed bug 853: catch and ignore exceptions caused by asynchronous
  activity in the thread panel during a session deactivation.

  commands for managing the sets of session settings.
- Implemented RFE 846: added 'capture' command to control output of
  JSwat messages to alternative locations.
- Implemented RFE 847: added 'logging' command to enable and disable
  internal logging by category name.
- Implemented RFE 850: try to read the SourceFile attribute from the
  .class file when looking for the source code (and the source file
  name could not be determined otherwise).

  over anything selected in the list.
- Fixed bug 824: use generic breakpoint support for setting breakpoints
  in source code that caused a parser error.
- Fixed bug 825: display parser errors in source view using a red line
  highlighter and a tooltip to show the cause of the error.

2.19 - December 5, 2003
- Renamed the startup file from .jswatrc to jswat.init as that makes
  more sense. Also, the file ~/.jswat/init takes the place of the
  ~/.jswat/jswatrc file. Be sure to rename these files, if they exist.
- Implemented RFE 463: add support for non-Java programming languages
  via a modified form of Daniel Bonniot's patch. This support is very

  finally working correctly, according to the JLS.
- Fixed bug 548: rewrote all of the expression evaluator operator nodes
  so they handle the numbers correctly according to the JLS.

  no open views meant that new tabbed views used old look and feel.
- Fixed bug 809: avoid concurrent modifications to the class tree
  data structure when the session deactivates during an update.
- Fixed bug 814: floating point literals suffixed with 'f' still
  were of type double, but should have been of type float when
  using the expression evaluator.
- Fixed bug 817: characters are handled as integrals in numeric
  operations within the expression evaluator.

2.18 - November 10, 2003
- Implemented RFE 514: new 'vminfo' command shows boot classpath.
- Implemented RFE 569: permit '*' to match any argument type when setting
  method breakpoints.
- Implemented RFE 658: source view shows breakpoint details in tooltip
  if mouse hovers over breakpoint indicator in source view gutter.

  value was null.
- Fixed bug 787: bytecodes command no longer uses regular expressions
  for class and method names because the result was undesirable.
- Fixed bug 788: bytecodes command now tries to use .class file data
  in favor of just the method bytecode retrieved from JDI.
- Fixed bug 789: method breakpoints can now be set on constructors.
- Fixed bug 790: check for instance filter support in debuggee before
  using them in watch panel and watchpoints.

2.17 - May 21, 2003
- Fixed bug 649: disallow quick-copy of selected text from a text
  component to the text areas that are not editable.
- Fixed bug 727: very long classpath would cause exceptions.

  a file stored inside a zip or jar.
- Fixed bug 768: Michael M. submitted a patch to allow breakpoints to
  resolve within inner classes defined inside interfaces.
- Fixed bug 769: alias command needs to strip enclosing quotes because
  command parser does not and thus multi-command aliases would fail.
- Fixed bug 770: corrected bad alias example in command help.

- Fixed bug 762: removing breakpoint group now properly deletes the
  breakpoints contained in that group.
- Fixed bug 764: show class names in the methods submenu of the source
  view popup menu, so it is clear where they are defined.

2.15 - April 9, 2003
- Jay Gindin added the keyboard mnemonics for the top-level menus and
  the command input field. He also added a few more keyboard shortcuts.
  I added the menu item mnemonics for nearly all of the menu items.
  You will want to remap some of your keyboard shortcuts since they
  may conflict with the new menu mnemonics.
- Neeraj Apte added the goto-line menu item, the short method
  descriptions in source view popup menu option, and sorted the methods
  in the source view popup menu.
- Implemented RFE 709: added option to local variables panel to display
  static final fields.

  and over again.

2.14 - March 13, 2003
- Added a "hide zombie threads" item to the threads panel popup menu.
- Removed ancient artifact, the vmlist command (and the related action
  that has been hidden for some time now). It was an embarrassing
  misunderstanding that spawned this useless little cretin and now it
  is finally dead.
- Fixed bug 694: added a brief sleep to the 'next' command unit test
  to allow the debuggee to resume.
- Fixed bug 704: user input to the debuggee is sent to the output text
  area, to better simulate the input and output interaction.
- Fixed bug 714: source view popup menu would throw exception when the
  "Run to line" feature was invoked during an inactive session.
- Fixed bug 715: check that the .zip or .jar entry is actually a file
  when accessing it via the sourcepath setting. Otherwise treat it as
  a directory entry.
- Fixed bug 720: locals panel would display inappropriate error message
  when the local variable information was missing for a class.
- Fixed bug 723: make the threads panel auto-refresh an option, to
  avoid problems with applications with a high thread turn-over rate.

  not editable, instead of disabled, so it is scrollable.

2.13 - January 29, 2003
- Abolished the use of the Logger to report errors and warnings. Instead,
  problems are dealt with more appropriately or are reported via the
  messages text area.
- Use bold for changed variables in the locals panel, as that is much
  easier to notice while single-stepping.
- Implemented RFE 42: classes panel now shows methods for the classes.
  Double-clicking on a method node opens the source to that location.
- Implemented RFE 707: indicate breakpoint resolution in the breakpoint
  properties dialog.
- Fixed bug 660: do not let a failed resolution for one class stop
  the scanning loop from finding another that might work.
- Fixed bug 676: the log was using an unreliable method for stopping
  the flusher thread. Only the unit tests seemed to be calling this
  method, which is why the bug was filed as a unit test bug.
- Fixed bug 702: methods panel was not properly deactivating.
- Fixed bug 703: stack and methods panel allowed useless selection.
- Fixed bug 706: use verbose error messages in the display panels.

  source code for the type of the selected variable.
- Implemented RFE 506: certain actions are disabled when the debuggee
  is running, or when it is not running.

- Implemented RFE 559: use expression evaluator for disablegc, dump,
  enablegc, and locks commands.

  only for caught or uncaught exceptions, rather than always stopping
  in either case.
- Implemented RFE 628: uncaught exceptions breakpoint may now stop for
  both uncaught and caught exceptions (or neither).
- Implemented RFE 664: allow copying the properties in the about dialog.
- Implemented RFE 665: show shortcut key in toolbar button tooltip.
- Implemented RFE 695: added option to use small buttons for the toolbar.

  will cause the breakpoints to resolve successfully.
- Fixed bug 565: added refresh command to clear cached views from the
  console adapter.

  stale after a hotswap operation.
- Fixed bug 653: enable the display of hidden files and directories
  in the file selectors.

  in the locals and stack panels.
- Fixed bug 683: popup menus now change look and feel appropriately.
- Fixed bug 684: custom tree cell renderers did not get look and feel
  change events.
- Fixed bug 685: threads and threadgroups commands now indicate the
  parent thread groups.
- Fixed bug 686: disable node selection in the threads, classes, and
  locals panels. It is useless and looks untidy.
- Fixed bug 687: removed the useless "LOCALS" and "CLASSES" nodes from
  the local variables and classes panels.
- Fixed bug 688: display an appropriate message in the stack panel when
  the thread is not in a compatible state (for displaying the stack).

- Fixed bug 693: clicking in source view acquires keyboard focus.
- Fixed bug 700: make the watch panel useful by making the name column
  cells editable again.

- Fixed bug 657: re-select the previous look and feel menu item if an
  error occurs while changing to a new look and feel.
- Fixed bug 663: added close buttons to about, evaluate, and window
  list dialogs. Removed breakpoints dialog because it was redundant.

  debugger to find source files in their new location the next time
  they are requested using a class name.
- Fixed bug 625: editing the classpath and sourcepath elements is now
  easier with a new Modify button and a dialog for editing the path
  entry. Additionally, the classpath editing dialog is now accessible
  while the session is active (although editing is still disallowed).
- Fixed bug 637: scroll the source view horizontally if needed to
  show matching text when searching.

  when evaluating text under mouse.
- Fixed bug 655: renamed the "session" menu items in the File menu
  so their purpose is more obvious.
- Fixed bug 659: changed upgrading message to say "2.x" instead of
  "2.0" since an upgrade could be directly from 1.x to 2.x.
- Fixed bug 661: source views are reloaded when the refresh action is
  invoked, useful when code may be changed during debugging.

2.9 - October 6, 2002

  provided by Kenji Nakamura. This does not include the help files.
- Implemented RFE 619: added remote attach button to toolbar.
- Implemented RFE 631: added remote detach button to toolbar.
- Fixed bug 615: uncaught exception breakpoint no longer halts when a
  thread is told to stop (which generates a ThreadDeath Error).

  manageable. By default it is created when JSwat starts, if it does
  not already exist.
- Fixed bug 627: local variables always showed as changed (red color).
- Fixed bug 630: if there are no field variables and the debug info is
  not available, then display "no debugging info" instead of "none" in
  the local variables panel.
- Fixed bug 632: classpath property is now set automatically only during
  the startup of JSwat. Connecting to a remote VM will no longer overwrite
  the classpath setting.
- Fixed bug 635: static field variables in static methods were not shown
  in the locals panel when "hide under 'this'" option was enabled.
- Fixed bug 640: locals panel was showing default node icons rather than

  methods with detailed opcode information, if available.
- Implemented RFE 605: 'threadbrk' supports on-death and on-start
  conditions to control when the breakpoint is considered hit.
- Fixed bug 586: made the implicit "*." on breakpoints optional, with
  the default being off (because it was causing me problems).
- Fixed bug 588: method breakpoint without arguments eventually caused
  a null pointer exception when persisting the breakpoint.
- Fixed bug 589: mouse released events in the source view gutter will
  no longer affect the breakpoint defined at that line when the popup
  menu is still visible.
- Fixed bug 590: make sure breakpoint properties dialog does not slip
  behind the main window when an error message appears.
- Fixed bug 591: make sure the -jar option is supported when launching
  the debuggee from either the Start VM dialog or the load command.
- Fixed bug 592: made the tutorial reference in the help index page
  to not be a link; avoids proxy errors for users behind a firewall.
- Fixed bug 594: made the README.html notes about preferences errors
  a little more generic to cover more problem cases.
- Fixed bug 595: 'class' and 'field' commands failed to check if the
  session was active, causing a null pointer exception.

  session listeners that the debuggee had suspended.
- Fixed bug 598: invoking 'filter del ...' on breakpoint with no
  filters would throw a null pointer exception.

  arguments more gracefully.
- Fixed bug 602: thread filters on some types of breakpoints were
  throwing exceptions.

  session listeners, which would have eventually led to problems.
- Fixed bug 606: changing a thread breakpoint from "on start" to
  "on death" made the breakpoint not stop at all.
- Fixed bug 607: the 'set' command was failing to up-cast values to
  greater precision types (e.g. byte to int, or short to long).

  naturally by using java.util.prefs.Preferences instead of files.
- Implemented RFE 435: persist breakpoints to java.util.prefs.Preferences

  in JDK 1.4.
