# "handlers" specifies a comma separated list of log Handler classes.
# These handlers will be installed during VM startup. Note that these
# classes must be on the system classpath. By default we only
# configure a FileHandler, which will write to a file in the user's home.
# We log to a file for performance reasons: if we'd log to stdout, it
# would appear in jEdit's activity log, and this is slow.
handlers=java.util.logging.FileHandler


# Default global logging level.
# This specifies which kinds of events are logged across all loggers.
# For any given facility this global level can be overriden by a
# facility specific level. Note that the ConsoleHandler also has a
# separate level setting to limit messages printed to the console.

# the filename of the log file

# limit the size of the log file to be 2MB

# use SimpleFormatter instead of the default XMLFormatter
# Note that we can't use JSwat's SimpleFormatter here (see class
# com.bluemarsh.jswat.logging.SimpleFormatter), because Sun's crappy logging
# toolkit only allows formatters accessible by the system class loader
# (and JSwat's SimpleFormatter is loaded through jEdit's plugin class loader!).
